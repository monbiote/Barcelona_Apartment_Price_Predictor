# Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create three model (Linear, Lasso, and Ridge) to understand the factors that influence property values 
and forecast future prices to maximize returns on real estate investments and make crucial informed decisions about the market. 
This will be done by analyzing historical data, market trends, and key determinants that impact property values,
we will endeavor to develop a robust predictive model capable of estimating apartment prices with a high degree of accuracy.
